## Setup

### Requirements:

-   [`Node.js (v14+)`](https://nodejs.org/ 'Node.js') - to run the bot.

### Steps:

-   Clone the repo and `cd` to the folder:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/ayannw/mitsuha.git
cd mitsuha
```

-   Install dependencies:

```sh
npm install
```

We recommend using [`Yarn`](http://yarnpkg.com/ 'Yarn') but you can still use npm.

-   Now edit the file `.env` and put your bot's credentials. You can get them from [`Discord developer portal`](https://discord.com/developers/ 'Discord developer portal').

-   Now start the bot using `npm run start` or `yarn start`.
    > Doesn't work ? Make sure you have put right credentials and try again. If it still doesn't work, please [open an issue](https://github.com/ayannw/mitsuha/issues/new 'create a new issue').
