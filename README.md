# Mitsuha
Multi-purpose Discord bot built with TypeScript and Discord.js.

<hr />

## Setup
### Requirements:

 - [`Node.js (v14+)`](https://nodejs.org/ "Node.js") - to run the bot.

### Steps:
 
 - Clone the repo and `cd` to the folder: 

```sh
git clone https://github.com/ayannw/mitsuha.git
cd mitsuha
```

 - Install dependencies:

```sh
npm install
```

We recommend using [`Yarn`](http://yarnpkg.com/ "Yarn") but you can still use npm.

 - Now edit the file `.env` and put your bot's credentials. You can get them from [`Discord developer portal`](https://discord.com/developers/ "Discord developer portal").
 
 - Now start the bot using `npm run start` or `yarn start`.
 > Doesn't work ? Make sure you have put right credentials and try again. If it still doesn't work, please [open an issue](https://github.com/ayannw/mitsuha/issues/new "create a new issue").
